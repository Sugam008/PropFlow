# Contributing to Vibe-Coding Prompt Template

Thanks for your interest in improving the Vibe-Coding workflow! 🙌  
Pull requests and issue reports are welcome.

## Before you start

- Read the README to understand the goals of this project and its scope.
- Review the Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to follow it.

This repo focuses on **prompt templates, documentation, and workflow improvements**, not on hosting production code.

## How to propose changes

### Bug reports / issues

- Use GitHub Issues.
- Include:
  - What you were trying to do.
  - The exact section/file (e.g. `part2-prd-mvp.md`, `AGENTS.md`).
  - What went wrong or was unclear.
  - If relevant, which AI tool / IDE you used (Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.).

### Suggesting improvements

Good candidates for contributions:

- Clarifying confusing wording in prompts or docs.
- Updating examples for newer AI tools or model versions.
- Adding missing steps or checks to the workflow.
- Fixing typos, formatting, or broken links.

Out of scope (will usually be closed):

- Project-specific prompts tightly coupled to a single private stack.
- Vendor marketing or non-neutral comparisons.

Open an issue first for any **large** change so we can agree on direction.

## Pull request guidelines

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
- Keep PRs focused and small where possible.
- Update any relevant docs (README, partX files, AGENTS.md comments, etc.).
- Add a short description explaining:
  - What changed.
  - Why it helps users of the workflow.
  - Any breaking changes to existing instructions.

Maintainers may ask for tweaks before merging.

## Style and formatting

- Use clear, concise English.
- Prefer actionable, step-by-step instructions for contributors using AI tools.
- Follow the existing heading hierarchy and Markdown style in the repo.
- When mentioning tools (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.), use their current names and link to their official docs when adding new references.
