# Security Policy

## Overview
This repository provides templates for building MVPs with AI coding agents. While it contains no executable code, responsible usage of these templates requires security awareness.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 2.0   | ❌ No             |

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management
- Never commit `.env` files with API keys
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Rotate keys if accidentally exposed

### AI Platform Data Privacy
- Review data retention policies: [Claude](https://anthropic.com), [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev), [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
- Use business/enterprise accounts for proprietary code
- Disable data sharing in consumer Claude accounts

### Generated Code Security
- **Always review** AI-generated code before deployment
- Run security scanners (npm audit, Snyk, etc.)
- Test in isolated environments first
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications

### MCP Server Credentials
- Treat MCP connections like production database credentials
- Restrict agent access to non-production systems during development

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in the prompt templates or workflow:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email: [your-email] or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Scope
This security policy covers:
- ✅ Vulnerabilities in prompt templates that could lead to insecure practices
- ✅ Issues with recommended workflows that expose user data
- ❌ Security issues in code generated by users with these templates
- ❌ Third-party AI platform vulnerabilities
